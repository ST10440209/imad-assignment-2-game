#Whisker Kingdom

 My game is called “Whisker Kingdom” and it is about a cute cat that reacts to the player or users interactions. The players can interact with the cat by feeding , bathing and entertaining the cat for example playing with it and you can do all these things just by clicking the different buttons on the app and the players have to keep a close eye on the cats cleanliness, hunger, and health status to make sure the cat is well and taken care off.
One of the challenges I faced creating the game was trying to make sure that the game was running properly and my code was correct.
Players of all ages who appreciate lighthearted gaming, virtual pets, and casual gaming can enjoy Whisker Kingdom. By highlighting its engaging features and incorporating effective marketing strategies we can attract a loyal player in no time.
